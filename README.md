## Project Senario:

Mint Classics Company, a distinguished retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles, confronts a substantial challenge. They are deliberating the closure of one of their storage facilities, and this pivotal decision relies on comprehensive data analysis. The primary objective is to streamline inventory management while prioritizing swift and effective customer service â€“ a pivotal element for the company's success.

In your capacity as a data analyst, you hold a crucial position in this undertaking. Your task involves utilizing MySQL Workbench to deeply explore the intricacies of the company's operations by meticulously scrutinizing the available data. Operating within a designated data model and utilizing sample data tables, your meticulous analysis aims to pinpoint key data facets that will facilitate well-informed decisions regarding inventory reduction.


### Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the Database using MySQL Queries

#### Problem:-

To analyze data in a relational database using MySQL queries with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.

## Demonstrated Skills:
    1. Data Analysis: I'll employ SQL to extract and scrutinize data within the Mint Classics relational database.
    2. Business Understanding:  I'll thoroughly comprehend the database structure and the operational intricacies of Mint Classics to propose pertinent solutions.
    3. Decision-Making:  I'll craft actionable recommendations derived from the insights gleaned through data analysis, aiding in informed decision-making processes.

## Tools Used:

    1. MySQL Workbench: This tool is utilized for importing the database, running SQL queries, and analyzing data.
    2. GitHub: The project and reports will be uploaded to GitHub as part of the portfolio.



### Task 1 - Importing the Classic Car Model Database
### Task 2 - Comprehending the Mint Classics Database and Its Operational Procedures
### Task 3 - Exploring Business Challenges and Determining Relevant Tables
### Task 4 - Creating Recommendations to Resolve Business Challenges
### Task 5 - Developing Conclusions and Recommendations Supported by SQL Analysis

### Questions :

    1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?
    2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?
    3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?
    4) If we decrease the stocks by 5% for each of the products does it affect the sales?
    5) Is price a major factor in popularity of the products?
    6) What is profit percentage earned in the products that were sold the most?
    7) What is profit percentage earned in the products that were sold the least?



### Method
We used SQL queries on MySQL Workbench to perform exploratory data analysis. To begin with, we with imported the database using the SQL script linked here- [mintclassics DB](https://github.com/sujeet424/Analyze_Data_in_a_Model_Car_Database_with_MySQL_Workbench/blob/master/File_MySQL/Kk6HcEYrS-23P-RaCeFG2Q_8cc95a70f07644cc9cba5af99ad5b1f1_mintclassicsDB.sql) and studied the schema using the EER (Extended Entity-Relationship diagram). Further, we identified the tables and fields that could provide relavent informations to the questions asked above and support our insights. 
We begin this project with analyzing historical sales data, identifying trends, and assessing stock levels. By reallocating orders, optimizing inventory, and considering price adjustments, the aim was to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize profitability while ensuring product availability and customer satisfaction. This approach aligns with modern supply chain principles and business management.
